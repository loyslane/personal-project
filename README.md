# Pregnancy Weight Tracker

A Pregnancy weight tracker app that allows women to track their weight for each week of their pregnancy.

### To-do:

* Add an estimate of how much weight should be gained during each week or month, and compare if the pregnant woman is on track.
* Add profile information for pregnancy including height and weight to adjust the amount of weight gain expected for underweight or overweight individuals.
* Add a better visual way to add and view weights (possibly a calendar format).
